# artwork gallery

This artwork repository contains some of the painings I made. I am a musician, 
educator and a programmer from Croatia inspired by meditation which deeply connects
this work and my life. I like to describe these paintings an energy fields, in
which expressions do the subtle work of constantly shifting the image itself,
making it a bit out of focus, which in turn induces a variety of feelings and images.
Perspective may evolve over time and usually people that see these images observe 
something unique each time. And then they feel a variety of feelings
which makes myself happy to witness. Hope you like it too. The loading of the page
might be slow due to the high quality photos of the paintings. You can reach me at
